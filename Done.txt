Things done:
- Fixed camera;
- Fixed Enemy Melee prefab;
- Respawning (checkpoint positions were not initialized; after the fix, player wouldn't be respawned
  as his last known position is beyound the checkpoint itself);
- Fixed not aligned number in inventory 
- Added lights and torches (better atmosphere)
- Changed control in Respawn to reposition the facing direction of the player so to make it correct
- Fixed enemy (MeleeStateEnemy) that checked the ground too deeply
