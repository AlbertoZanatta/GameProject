Game Idea
The game we were thinking about developing is a take on 2D side - scrolling games which tries to mix a capture-the-flag mechanic with combat and RPG-like elements.
More precisely, the game will entail the following mechanics:
- The player starts from an initial position and has to capture a flag-item and take it back to the spot where he was initially spawned. To reach the 'flag' he needs to face different kind of enemies, challenges and environmental hazards.
  The 'flag' could be 'protected' by a final-level-boss whose defeat spawns the 'flag' itself and makes it possible for the player to capture it.
  As soon as the player gets the flag the design and the characteristics of the level change in order to make the travelling-back more interesting and challenging.
- The player can 1) collect pickups that help him regain health
                 2) progress faster by getting better weapons and armors by overcoming some particular challenging or spending some sort of in-game currency
                 3) replay the levels to get better equipments and get to areas previously inaccessible.
We are going to design three different levels with increasing difficulty - e.g. more complex layout of the level, enemies more difficult to beat or greater in the numbers, fewer pick up items to help the player survive.
We are still discussing about the setting, but we would like to set it in a fictional viking-style world.
