- Problema del salto 
- Attacco istantaneo + cooldown //As people felt the attack feedback from the viking was odd, tried to make
                                  it feel more 'instant' by removing a frame to the attack animation and enabling
                                  the box collider of the axe one more frame at the end of the animation.
				  Furthermore, in order to make the attack feel more responsive and to respond to
                                  some feedback provided during the playtesting day, we adjusted the cooldown time
                                  of the Player's attack so that it matches the repositioning of the axe in its
                                  'default' position. Some players argued that it felt strange not being able
                                   to attack after the attack animation finished and the character returned
                                   to its idle appearance.
- LAVA LEVEL: piattaforme che sprofondano nella lava.
- Sistemare bocca del vulcano
- Sistema di vite e checkpoint
- Nerfare la strega (fermarla in idle state dopo qualche attacco)
- Sistemare collisioni negli attacchi //Other problems presented by the combat system were the following: the sprite
                                        of the player and of the enemy would overlap in such ways that the player
                                        couldn't attack the opponent (as the box collider of its axe would not
                                        collide with the enemy's collider) and the opponent could damage the player
                                        even with him parrying (as his weapons could reach the body collider behind
                                        the shield collider).
                                        We tried to handle this problem in different ways:
					Allowing players and opponents to collide. This however presented some of the
                                        same problems we wanted to avoid by allowing the player and the enemy to overlap:
                                        the player could jump over enemies, and the opponents' attacks would result
                                        in force being applied to the character ridgibdody which in consequence would
                                        slide further away from the enemy.
                                        The second solution was reworking the artificial intelligence of the enemies
                                        to make them more aware of the 'overlapping situation'.
					This in the end entailed making the opponent moving backward for a few frames
                                        when the player is within a fixed 'Overlap distance'. This also resulted in a
                                        more interesting enemy behaviour - enemies attack the player from behind if
                                        he comes too close. But lso a strange 'back and forth' movement in certain situations
                                        that still we were not able to fix.

- Getti di lava
- Spike che scompaiono alla prima volta
- Ice blocks not destructible
- Color of background a bit different
- Attack - match cooldown time with animation ##
- Visual indication of impaired movement
- Fewer tiles in the breakable falls
- Check breakable ice section
- Improve stalactites placement
- Breakable turrets (?)
- Bordi alla mappa
- Button highlighted main menu (?)
- Collectables (trigger quando cade sul terreno)
- Tile (problema state machine)
- Sincro : piattaforme jimping part e piattaforma dopo cascate di lava
- Too long jump on the left of first platform allows to bypass the death line
- GameController returns one life less ##
- Damage from high fall?
- Making final enemy in the first level bigger ##

//THIRD PLAY SESSION
- Color of the lavafall (does not seem to damage)
- First tile jumping part lava level hit even while parrying
- Lava jumping part: synch platforms
- Witches always have to drop loot because they are difficult to kill and this encourages the player to kill them. Otherwise player will skip
- Game controller respawns with one life less ##

//As we found that combat was not very engaging and for the most part people would rush through the enemies
 in order to reach their final goal, we tried to change our approach in designing the levels for the two later
 stages of the game: we tried to make the level itself more engaging by allowing the player to interact with
 the environment and have him interact with some small puzzles to pave his way to the objective.

//As the control scheme is not very intuitive an neither is the main goal of the game, we designed a step by step
tutorial covering the first half of the beginning level.  

//In order to motivate the player to engage with the combat system and face the different kinds of opponents
we introduce a simple loot system. At their death, opponents drop valuable items (potions, throwable knifes, keys)
that help the player proceeding further into the level.

LEVEL2 
//Make it more challenging to reach the top of the vulcano (added traps)
//Reduce some enemies
//Added a new checkpoint at the top of the vulcano, so that the player can be respawned there if he dies in the final battle
//Door
//Dynamically create level beginning for levelBack



BUGFIXING:
- Fixed camera;
- Fixed Enemy Melee prefab;
- Respawning (checkpoint positions were not initialized; after the fix, player wouldn't be respawned
  as his last known position is beyound the checkpoint itself);
- Fixed not aligned number in inventory 
- Added lights and torches (better atmosphere)
- Changed control in Respawn to reposition the facing direction of the player so to make it correct
- Fixed enemy (MeleeStateEnemy) that checked the ground too deeply
- Level selection
- Lives system
- Add exit game button in main menu
- Fixed controls menu not showing nd game time frozen when pause the game and return to main menu
- Reworked the control system
- Improved navigation through the different menus allowing for the use of arrows
- Fixed problem that player goes through ground when respawning
- Fixed the fact that collectable objects can be moved by enemies

OTHER THINGS:
- Choose a name for the game!!
